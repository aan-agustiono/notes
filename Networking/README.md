## Differences Between Network Edge and Core

| Core Network	| Edge Network |
|--- | --- |
| Has more hops to the adjacent networks compared to edge networks |	Has fewer hops to their adjacent networks |
| Contains level 2 and level 3 devices |	Has few or no layer 3 devices |
| Contains a large number of core layer devices, such as high-end routers and switches with redundant links |	Contains a large number of edge layer devices, such as routing switches, firewalls, multiplexers |
| Access switches are placed in the core of the network |	Access switches are placed near the network edge |
| The first hop router is more likely to be an MPLS routing protocol such as OSPF, BGP |	The first hop router is typically an IP routing protocol such as PBR, VRRP |
