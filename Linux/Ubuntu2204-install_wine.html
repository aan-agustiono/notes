<b>Install Wine</b><hr>
<code>
The next command installs Wine Stable. To install Wine Development or Wine Staging, replace winehq-stable  by  winehq-devel or winehq-staging

After a major Wine upgrade (from Wine 6 to Wine 7, for example), Wine Stable may temporarily be unavailable, but Wine Development and Wine Staging can still be installed.
</code>
<pre>$ sudo apt install --install-recommends winehq-stable</pre>

Verify the installation succeeded
<pre>$ wine --version</pre>

<b>Configure Wine</b>
The default Wine configuration prepares Wine as a Windows 7 environment, which is good for some older Windows apps, but many contemporary apps will be better matched to Windows 8.1 or Windows 10. In addition, other configuration options may be significant.

To bring up Wine's configuration panel, open a Terminal window and execute winecfg. If installing mono or gecko is offered, accept the offer. When prompted, set your preferred version of Windows.
<pre>
$ wine winecfg
</pre>
If you are creating custom Wine prefixes, this configuration must be repeated for each prefix.

Two simple tests
Just for fun, or to see Wine in action â€¦

Display a simple clock

Run Wine's builtin web browser
If installing gecko is offered, accept the offer.

Lately, iexplore fails to run properly on some distributions. If the window that opens is solid black, click the Refresh button to obtain partial functionality. Scrolling does not work, but links and window resizing do.

<pre>$ wine iexplore</pre>
