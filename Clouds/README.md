<p>Unfortunately, not all self-hosted solutions have passed the test of time:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vmware-archive/kubeless-website">Kubeless</a>, <a href="https://github.com/iron-io/functions">Iron Functions</a>, <a href="https://space-cloud.io/">Space Cloud</a>, <a href="https://github.com/open-lambda/open-lambda">OpenLambda</a>, <a href="https://funktion.fabric8.io/">Funktion</a>, and <a href="https://fnproject.io/">Fn Project</a> seem to be mostly “dead” nowadays.</li>
<li><a href="https://openwhisk.apache.org/">OpenWhisk</a> could be said to be alive, but it has not had a single release since November 2020. This framework is barely mentioned, especially in the context of a self-hosted Kubernetes solution (the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CNCF_Survey_Report_2020.pdf">CNCF report for 2020</a> shows that only 3% of serverless users use it).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS</a> seems to be progressing well and is quite popular in the community (10% of users favor it).</li>
<li><a href="https://knative.dev/docs/">Knative</a> is thriving and looks to be the most promising overall (27% of users choose it). Version 1.0 was released in November 2021.</li>
<li><a href="https://fission.io/">Fission</a> has regular releases (the most recent one was on December 29, 2021), but it is not widely used (2% of users).</li>
<li><a href="https://nuclio.io/">Nuclio</a> has its own Open Source version. However, it lacks an auto-scaling feature in general and scaling to zero specifically, thus it won’t be subsequently considered in this article.</li>
</ul>
